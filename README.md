# bits-n-pieces
A collection of scripts to problems that I come across.

- Beginner Regex Practice Scripts
- Python Flask startup scripts(working on it)
- Assorted problems on:
  Hackerrank,
  Hackerearth or,
  Codility.
 
  Will try to :
  - Link to the problem/question and 
  - Document the code in a way that's readable for others.
