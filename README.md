# bits-n-pieces
A collection of scripts to problems that I come across.

- Beginner Regex Practice Scripts
- Python Flask startup scripts(working on it)
- Assorted problems on:

  [Hackerrank](www.hackerrank.com),

  [Hackerearth](www.hackerearth.com) or,
  
  [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/), 
  
  and from [Interviewqs](https://www.interviewqs.com/).
  
 - These solutions are scripted in Python, Java, Javascript.
 
  Will try to :
  - [ ] Link to the problem/question and 
  - [ ] Document the code in a way that's readable for others.
  - [ ] Add C++ scripts to this collection.

P.S. separate repo for miniprojects, ideas, and hackathon projects.
