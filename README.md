# bits-n-pieces
A collection of scripts to problems that I come across.

- Beginner Regex Practice Scripts
- Python Flask startup scripts(working on it)
- Assorted problems on:
  [Hackerrank](www.hackerrank.com),
  [Hackerearth](www.hackerearth.com) or,
  [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/).
 
  Will try to :
  - [ ] Link to the problem/question and 
  - [ ] Document the code in a way that's readable for others.

P.S. separate repo for miniprojects, ideas, and hackathon projects.
